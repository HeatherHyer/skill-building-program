## About the Badges

Prove your abilities and knowledge through earning badges in each level of a
number of categories!
We have the ability to earn badges in the following levels:

- Apprentice
- Journeyman
- Master

### Apprentice
You are getting your feet wet in a skill category. You will use study materials
to prove a basic knowledge of a skill. You will also be proving your ability in
that skill through building a microproject with a very specific and prescriptive
set of requirements. As an alternative to building new projects, you may use
previous work and a few other options to pass this level's badges.

### Journeyman
You are actively applying your knowledge to produce quality code in new and
creative ways. You are also demonstrating your knowledge of advanced concepts in
your production code. As an alternative to project work, a developer can use
previous project or production work to pass this level's badges.

### Master
You have mastered the fundamental and advanced concepts of this skill and you
are very skilled in its' application. You often mentor and teach others in this
skill. You also often act in an architectural role, helping to define our work
patterns and recommending helpful technologies and methodologies. This level
expects that you will propose, produce, and teach a project on this skill area.


-----


## Learning Time
You have permission to spend up to 10% of your work time on training. This means
45 minutes per day, 4 hours a week, or whatever way works best for you.
Please try to schedule and communicate this time in a way that minimizes the effect
to your story council and other responsibilities.


-----


## Build portfolio & project repos
You can build a portfolio to contain your skill projects, or make them separate Github
repos. Through this program, you should have a good body of work to prove your
skills with.


-----


## Comprehensive levels:
Once you've earned all the required badges in a level, you are granted a title:

- **Apprentice**: "_________"
- **Journeyman**: "Web Ninja"
- **Master**:     "_________"
