## About the Badges

Prove your abilities and knowledge through earning badges in each level of a
number of categories!
We have the ability to earn badges in the following levels:

- Apprentice
- Journeyman
- Master

### Apprentice
You are getting your feet wet and gaining basic literacy in a skill category. You will use study materials to prove a basic knowledge of a skill. You will also be proving your ability in that skill through building a micro-project with a very specific and prescriptive set of requirements. As an alternative to building new projects, you may use previous work and a few other options to pass this level's badges. Expect 3-6hrs spent per apprentice badge.

### Journeyman
You are actively applying your knowledge to produce quality code in new and creative ways. You are also demonstrating your knowledge of advanced concepts in your production code. As an alternative to project work, a developer can use previous project or production work to pass this level's badges. Expect 8-16hrs spent per Journeyman badge.

### Master
You have mastered the fundamental and advanced concepts of this skill and you are very skilled in its' application. You often mentor and teach others in this skill. You also often act in an architectural role in the webdev discipline, helping to define our work patterns and recommending helpful technologies and methodologies. This level expects that you will propose, produce, and teach a project on this skill area.


-----


## Learning Time
You have permission to spend up to 10% of your work time on training. This means 45 minutes per day, 4 hours a week, or whatever way works best for you. Please try to schedule and communicate this time in a way that minimizes the effect to your story council and other responsibilities.


## Skills Workshops
About every two weeks, we hold a skills workshop on Friday afternoon, for about 2 hours. We have an instructor-led, interactive session to educate and get these badges passed off together. We choose the next workshop's topic with this app in the "Next Skills Workshop" category. - [FS-Voter App](http://fs-vote.meteor.com/category/skill-program-workshop)

-----


## Build portfolio & project repos
You *can* build a portfolio to contain your skill projects, or make them separate Github repos. Through this program, you should have a good body of work to prove your skills with.


-----


## Comprehensive levels:
Once you've earned all the required badges in a level, you are granted a title:

- **Apprentice**: "_________"
- **Journeyman**: "Web Ninja"
- **Master**:     "_________"
