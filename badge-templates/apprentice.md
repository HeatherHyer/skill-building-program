- You have demonstrated that you have an introductory-level understanding and skill in {Skill Category}


-----


## Suggested Assignment(s)
*(These can have slightly prescriptive requirements in Apprentice level only)*

  - Make a real working thing from code that proves it
    - **Requirements:** Project must have: red shiny wiggles, tall pointy widgets, narrow fragrant towns, and slippery orange shakes. *(A few very specific technical items)*

Community suggested projects:

1) Make a wiggly widget that shows the latest wiggles from wiggle-town
2) Make a smooth tic-tac that plays a "funky what-now"



## Alternate Assignment(s)
1) Show previous work you've done that proves it
2) Make (and deliver?) a presentation that proves it (*should this be just master-level only, due to limited time in meetings?*)
3) Figure out how we currently use it in Frontier-based apps
4) Update/Improve/Create documentation for this where appropriate (Reference App, Confluence)
