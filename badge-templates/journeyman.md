## Suggested Assignment(s)
*(These should have more project-based requirements in Journeyman level)*

  - Make a real working thing from code that proves it
    - **Requirements:** Project must have: wiggles, widgets, towns, and shakes. *(A few general technical items)*

Community suggested projects:

1) Make a wiggly widget that shows the latest wiggles from wiggle-town using a town shake method.
2) Make a smooth tic-tac that plays a "funky what-now" and also updates itself in wiggle-time.



## Alternate Assignment(s)
1) Show previous work you've done that proves it
2) Make (and deliver?) a presentation that proves it (*should this be just master-level only, due to limited time in meetings?*)
3) Figure out how we currently use it in Frontier-based apps
4) Update/Improve/Create documentation for this where appropriate (Reference App, Confluence)
