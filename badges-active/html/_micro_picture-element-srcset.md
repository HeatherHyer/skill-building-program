HTML - Picture Element & srcset [Micro Badge]
=================================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundational knowledge in the `<picture>` Element and `srcset`.
- You should have some experience using all of the features of the `<picture>` element and the `srcset` attribute.


Intro
-----

> The picture element is a markup pattern that allows developers to declare multiple sources for an image. By using media queries, it gives developers control as to when and if those images are presented to the user.

> The srcset and sizes attributes extend the img and source elements to provide a list of available image sources and their sizes. Browsers can then use this information to pick the best image source. - [Responsive Images Community Group](http://responsiveimages.org/)

- [ ] At different page widths
- [ ] At different pixel ratios
- [ ] With `.webp` detection and conditional loading
- [ ] Working img fallback for browsers that don't support `srcset` or `<picture>`

2) Demonstrate how you've done all of #1 in your work or side-work
