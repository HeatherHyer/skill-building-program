## Intro

>Good authors divide their books into chapters and sections; good programmers divide their programs into modules.
Like a book chapter, modules are just clusters of words (or code, as the case may be).
Good modules, however, are highly self-contained with distinct functionality, allowing them to be shuffled, removed, or added as necessary, without disrupting the system as a whole. - [FreeCodeCamp - JavaScript Modules, a beginners' guide](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-modules-a-beginner-s-guide-783f7d7a5fcc)
