Est. to complete: 2hrs

## Intro

>Test like a user. -Protractor Home Page

Protractor is a end to end JavaScript testing framework built on WebdriverJS. It was originally built for testing Angular apps, but it has proven to be useful in testing other types of applications as well. It has a large and active community for support, so it should be easy to find answers to questions.

Note: This badge assumes that you have already installed protractor and know how to run a test; If not, start [here](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Suggested Assignments

1) Pick your favorite app (one that you've written, an approved company app, a basic sample app somewhere) and write tests that include the following:
  - [ ] At least one page object.
  - [ ] At least three different element locator types. (in the page object(s))
  - [ ] At least one helper function. (in the page object(s))
  - [ ] Modify the configuration file to test in multiple browsers, change which specs are run, and use a different reporter from the default.
  
2) Demonstrate that you've done all of the above in previous work.
