Performance - Auditing [Micro Badge]
=============================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in Performance - Auditing.
- You should know how to audit multiple basic aspects of web performance, and which things may be perf "opportunities".


Intro
-----

> Data, or it didn't happen

Get data to know where you're at with performance, to pass/fail hypotheses, and to better understand how your app loads its' data. If you have data to back up your impressions, it will be much easier to communicate a perf issue with someone else, and much easier to identify what steps to take next.  

*Perf audits should happen both during feature development and post-release.* They usually cover 2 main categories: **Page load**, and **Runtime**. There are tons of awesome tools out there, and the more you understand your audit data, the quicker you can jump from finding a problem to solving it. **Empower yourself.**


Suggested Assignment(s)
--------------------

Choose one:

1) Audit, record, interpret, and improve a production page's web performance
  - [ ] Use tools from the suggested study to audit a production page
  - [ ] Explain all aspects of its' network waterfall
  - [ ] What is the page doing well for performance?
  - [ ] What is the page doing wrong for performance?
  - [ ] Outline a practical strategy for improving its' perceived performance
  - [ ] Outline a practical strategy for improving its' "Start Render" & "Page Load Time" Time performance. How do the strategies for each of these differ?
  - [ ] Improve an existing page's YSlow grade on "Small Site or Blog" preset or higher. Show before and after, and explain what you changed. (Don't make initial page artificially low grade)
  - [ ] Explain every category of a YSlow or PageSpeed test. Why do each matter? How can you improve in each?
