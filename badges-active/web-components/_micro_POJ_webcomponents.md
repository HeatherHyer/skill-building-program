## Intro

> “In an ideal scenario, the HTML language would be expressive enough to create complex UI widgets and also extensible so that we, the developers, could fill in any gaps with our own tags. Today, this is finally possible through a new set of standards called Web Components.” ― https://css-tricks.com/modular-future-web-components/
