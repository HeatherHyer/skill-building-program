Frontier - Triage of Support [Micro Badge]
=============================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in Frontier - Triage of Support.
- You should be confident in your ability to find answers on your own


Intro
-----

> Learn to find solutions independently

We can all get more work done when we rely on systems first. It's important to
try to find information yourself first before bringing humans into it. We have
some great information resources documented, so we should try those first. Let's
be sure to enable all of our coworkers to maintain focus without interruption,
if at all possible.  

If our documentation is lacking, find the answer, and add the answer to our
docs, so everyone can benefit from it in the future. Be sure to label or name
any items in confluence with the names people are most likely to use when
searching, so they will be more likely to find it.
