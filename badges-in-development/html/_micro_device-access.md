Frontier - Device Access [Micro Badge]
=================================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundational knowledge in the Device Access Browser API.
- You should have some experience using several features of the Device Access API, including Touch Events, Geolocation, and Device Orientation.


Intro
-----

> Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets usually have a capacitive touch-sensitive screen to capture interactions made with the user's fingers. As the mobile web evolves to enable increasingly sophisticated applications, web developers need a way to handle these events. For example, nearly any fast-paced game requires the player to press multiple buttons at once, which, in the context of a touchscreen, implies multi-touch. - [Multi-touch Web Development](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/touch/)
