HTML - Device Access [Micro Badge]
=================================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundational knowledge in the Device Access Browser API.
- You should have some experience using several features of the Device Access API, including Touch Events, Geolocation, and Device Orientation.


Intro
-----

> Many new computers, mobile phones and other devices are now shipping standard with accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses and other hardware designed to determine capture motion and orientation data. At the same time, web browsers are providing increasingly more access to that new hardware. One example of that are the new HTML5 DeviceOrientation and DeviceMotion events. These events provide developers with information about the orientation, motion and acceleration of the device. - [This End Up - Using Device Orientation](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/)
