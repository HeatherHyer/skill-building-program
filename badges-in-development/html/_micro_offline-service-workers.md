HTML - Offline & Service Workers [Micro Badge]
=================================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated basic foundational knowledge in "Offline Web" features.
- You should have some experience using several features of "Offline Web", such as Offline Events and Service Workers.


Intro
-----

> With home broadband and smartphones, the human race is increasingly reliant on the internet, but the internet isn't always with us. [...] I'm sure you're all familiar with this [...] That kind of thing, the sinking feeling of being abandoned by connectivity. You're stuck outside while the internet parties without you. You can only imagine what youre missing out on. It could be anything, literally anything! A new video of a cat, a politician saying something stupid, world peace could be solved in 140 characters —— but you don't get to hear about it. [...] Total failure in the face of connectivity issues is a worst-case scenario, and it's all too common on the web, but no longer. - Jake Archibald, from [Offline Web Applications - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/offline-web-applications--ud899)
