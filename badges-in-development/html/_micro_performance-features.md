Intro
-----

> Modern browsers can deliver sites and applications that rival the performance of native and across loads of device types and screens. This performance does not come for free, however, and as developers we need to use a variety of techniques and technologies to get the most out of the browser. Performance is a critical part of user experience, it's a constant theme across all aspects of your development and product. - [HTML5 Features: Performance - HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/performance)
