Performance - Network & Caching [Micro Badge]
=============================================


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in Performance - Network & Caching.
- You should know how to audit multiple aspects of browser networking and caching.


Intro
-----

> Good developers know how things work.  
> Great developers know **why** things work. - Steve Souders

Browser networking and caching can seem like black magic sometimes. Let's dive into things, pull them apart, and put them back together so we can have a better knowledge, and make better-informed decisions about how we build our code, and how things affect it.


Suggested Assignment(s)
--------------------

Choose one:

1) Improve the Speed Index or Page Load Time of a page by optimizing its' images
  - [ ] Audit page's images. Record how many files, how much file-size they have when combined, and how long they take to download.
  - [ ] Are there any images that could be optimized further?
  - [ ] What percentage of the page's total file-size are image bytes?
  - [ ] What recommendations do your audit tools give you? (yslow, chrome dev tools, page speed insights)
  - [ ] Optimize image files as aggressively as you can without degrading the visual quality "too low" (subjective measurement)
  - [ ] Demonstrate what improvements these changes made to the page's performance metrics, esp. speed index and page load time
