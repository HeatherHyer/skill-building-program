Performance - Rendering Performance [Micro Badge]
=============================================

Time Estimate: 6 hours

Goals:
------

- We strongly recommend you finish the [Performance - Critical Render Path micro badge](_micro_critical-render-path.md) first.
- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in Performance - Rendering Performance.
- You should know how browser's rendering process works, and demonstrate some methods to optimize their effect on the page's performance.
- You should be very familiar with Paul Lewis' awesome accent.


Intro
-----

> You can't take a dropped frame in a video game. Why would users deal with a site that doesn't react quickly and render smoothly? If you keep users pleased they will keep conversions high.

60FPS, "Jank", R.A.I.L.  
You're about to go down the rabbit hole into render-performance-land...


Suggested Assignment(s)
-----------------------

Choose one:

1) Complete the Udacity course on browser rendering optimization by Google's Paul Lewis (@aerotwist):
[Udacity Course Link](https://www.udacity.com/course/browser-rendering-optimization--ud860)
  - [ ] Why is 60FPS important?
  - [ ] What is "jank"?
  - [ ] Describe "RAIL", and why each part is important for user experience
  - [ ] Discuss what CSS styles can trigger repainting
  - [ ] Demonstrate how to test the framerate of a webpage, and how to recognize dropped frames
