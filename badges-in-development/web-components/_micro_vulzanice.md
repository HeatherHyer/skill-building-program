# Web Components - Vulcanize [Micro Badge]

------

## Goals:

------

- You have demonstrated you understand the scope and use cases of vulcanize
- You have demonstrated understanding and the various ways you can vulcanize web components

-----

## Intro

> “Web pages that use multiple HTML Imports to load dependencies may end up making lots of network round-trips. In many cases, this can lead to long initial load times and unnecessary bandwidth usage. The Vulcanize tool follows HTML Imports and `<script>` tags to inline these external assets into a single page, to be used in production.
In the future, technologies such as HTTP/2 and Server Push will likely obsolete the need for a tool like vulcanize for production uses.” ― https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize

## Assignment(s)

Choose one:

1) Make a creative project that demonstrates the following:
- [ ] Vulcanization of a group of elements

2) Demonstrate how you've done all of #1 in your work or side-work

3) Something else creative that proves you are totally legit in this topic
