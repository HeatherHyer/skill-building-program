# How to make content for V2 Skill Building Program

Remember the program's structure.
There are **Categories**, like `JavaScript`.
Categories have Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master level **Composite** badges.
Each Composite badge is composed of several concise, topical *Micro-Badges*.

`Category > Composite > Micros`


## Look at previous examples

Go look at previously completed badge content, and observe how it is composed,
organized, and constructed. Make sure your content idea isn't already covered in
the current `badges-active` or `badges-in-development` directories.


## Is it already in progress?

Look on the [In-Progress Board](./in-progress-board.md). Have a quick chat with
someone on the skills council to see if someone else is already making content
about your idea. If they are, try to join efforts on it!


## Make a topical outline

Make a one-layer outline of the main topics in your category you think should be
known by webdevs. Then, split those topics into things you should know to "get
your feet wet", and things that are more advanced knowledge. Now you have the
basics of the Apprentice and Journeyman Composites. In each composite, determine
the "must know" items, and put them in the "Complete all" Section of
microbadges. If there are optional items, have the user choose one or more from
that group to complete, so they have some freedom in the way they complete the
composite badge


## Follow the templates

[Badge Templates](badge-templates/)

Use the `composite` template for your Apprentice and Journeyman composite
badges. Use the `master` template for your master composite badge, and use the
`micro` template for all of your micro badges. If you need some inspiration, go
look at the other completed badges in the program:
[badges-active/](Active Badges). Don't forget to make your content fun, free,
and not too prescriptive. The program is meant to inspire self-learning, and not
 hand-holding.


## Where to get content

The internet. Try to get interactive tutorials first, then videos, articles,
and eventually documentation sources if all else fails. The
skill-building-program is meant to be fun and interactive first. We work best
when standing on the shoulders of giants, so try to find the industry's best
content before making your own if possible.
